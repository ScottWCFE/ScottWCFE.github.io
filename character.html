         <h3>The two main characters in Cyberpunk 2077 are V, that is the customizable protagonist controlled by the player, and Johnny Silverhand, a Rock 'n' Roll star turned Semi-Terrorist towards Arasaka Corporation.</h3>
         <h3>For the first trailers released they used the male version of V to promote their game, and then when they decided to release a DLC they wanted to start anew, so they changed to the Female V for the DLC trailers to breathe new life into the most controversial release of a AAA game in recent times.</h3>
         <h6>I will not go to deep into any lore as this will not be my finished website and I plan to include more as I finish the game.</h6>
