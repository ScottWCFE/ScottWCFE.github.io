       <h3>They all have different styles, clothing is the thing that distinguish them the most.</h3>
       <h3>A gang like Malestrom have very intrusive cybernetic implants, this can be seen in the video on the cyberpsyhco page.</h3>
       <h3>The weapons vary a lot as well, a gang like the tyger claws would use swords and smart weapons, as the aldecaldos prefer power weapons and vehicles.</h3>
       <h3>Most gangs are filled with people who feel betrayed by the Mega-Corps and government after they were deployed to fight for these people without any help afterwards when America was still collapsed.</h3>
